# Swipe

An early experiment in the use of animations in React Native. The app displays a deck of cards in the style of Tinder. It uses React Native Elements to assist in styling, whilst using hard coded data for each card.

To get this set up, follow these steps:

1) cd Swipe
2) npm install
3) open in either Expo XDE or use 'react-native run-ios'
