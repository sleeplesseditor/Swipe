# Swipe

An early experiment in the use of animations in React Native. The app displays a deck of cards in the style of Tinder, with a swipe left/right animation. It uses React Native Elements to assist in styling, whilst using hard coded data for each card.

To get this set up, follow these steps:

1) cd Swipe
2) npm install
3) open in either Expo XDE or use 'react-native run-ios'
